# Medwheel
 Imagine a world where medication management is seamless, stress-free, and tailored to each patient. Introducing MedWheelâ€”an innovative, intelligent medication dispenser designed to transform how patients and doctors handle prescriptions. Our system integrates precision hardware and intuitive software to ensure patients never miss a dose. At the core is our motorized, Arduino-powered medicine wheel that dispenses the right medication at the right time.

  MedWheel represents the perfect blend of hardware and software, designed to create a seamless medication-taking experience. The hardware, powered by Arduino and programmed in C++, includes motors, sensors, switches, and a buzzer, all working harmoniously to ensure accurate medication dispensing. Our system is integrated with a comprehensive software solution: a secure website for doctors to assign medication schedules and monitor patient progress, and a custom-built mobile app that keeps patients on track with notifications and manual dispensing options.
Together, the software and hardware communicate in real-time, automatically recognizing when to dispense medication and responding to user requests. MedWheel simplifies medication management, making adherence effortless while prioritizing user safety and convenience.
