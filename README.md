Imagine a world where medication management is seamless, stress-free, and personalized for every patient. MedWheel makes this vision a reality—an innovative, intelligent medication dispensing solution designed to transform the way patients and healthcare providers handle prescriptions. Our system brings together precision-engineered hardware and user-centered software to ensure patients stay on top of their medication routines without a hitch. At the heart of MedWheel is our motorized, Arduino-powered "medicine wheel," a smart device that accurately dispenses the right medication at precisely the right time, making missed doses a thing of the past.

MedWheel embodies the ideal synergy between hardware and software, built to create a smooth, reliable medication experience. The hardware, driven by Arduino and programmed in C++, features an assembly of motors, sensors, switches, and a buzzer, all calibrated to ensure precise and dependable dispensing. This physical device is seamlessly integrated with a comprehensive software suite that includes a secure web portal for doctors and caregivers to assign medication schedules and track patient progress, as well as a custom mobile app that keeps patients informed with notifications and manual dispensing options. Through real-time communication between hardware and software, MedWheel automatically adjusts to each user’s schedule, dispensing medication exactly when it’s needed and responding to user inputs. MedWheel simplifies medication adherence, prioritizing patient safety and convenience, while offering healthcare providers valuable tools to ensure their patients’ health remains on track.
